# Product Context: JSCForm

## Problem Statement
Building forms in React applications is repetitive and error-prone. Developers often need to:
- Write boilerplate form code for each new form
- Implement validation logic manually
- Maintain consistency across different forms
- Handle complex form schemas and nested data structures
- Integrate with various UI component libraries

## Solution Approach
JSCForm solves these problems by providing a schema-driven approach to form generation:

### Core Value Propositions
1. **Schema-Driven Development**: Define forms using JSON Schema instead of writing React components
2. **Zero Boilerplate**: Generate complete forms with validation from schema definitions
3. **UI Library Agnostic**: Pluggable component system works with any UI library
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for schemas and form data
5. **Validation Built-in**: Automatic validation using industry-standard AJV

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **Rapid Development**: Create forms in minutes, not hours
- **Consistency**: Uniform form behavior across applications
- **Flexibility**: Easy customization through component registry
- **Debugging**: Clear error messages and validation feedback
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing React applications

### For End Users
- **Intuitive Forms**: Clean, accessible form interfaces
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on input errors
- **Responsive Design**: Forms that work across devices
- **Performance**: Fast rendering and interaction

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Admin Interfaces**: Configuration forms, user management, settings
2. **Data Entry**: Complex forms with nested objects and arrays
3. **Dynamic Forms**: Forms that change based on user input or external data
4. **API Integration**: Forms that map directly to API schemas

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Form Builders**: Tools that generate forms for non-technical users
2. **Survey Systems**: Dynamic questionnaires and feedback forms
3. **Configuration Management**: Application settings and preferences
4. **Workflow Forms**: Multi-step processes and wizards

## Success Metrics
- Reduced form development time (target: 80% reduction)
